# authentication in svelte(kit)

Coming from a Django background, these are my doodles with sveltekit and authentication.
The original code comes from a project linked from: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6315

I converted to .js and changed tabs to spaces (like Guido has proclaimed to be the right way to do it).
(generelly, I've removed everything that was not absolutely necessary for the authentication part)
